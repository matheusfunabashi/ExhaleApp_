# LungQuest App Development Plan

## App Overview
**LungQuest** is an iOS-native mobile app designed to help users quit vaping through gamification, targeting a younger audience (teens to young adults) with a professional, modern aesthetic. The core feature is a customizable "lung" character that visually heals (from damaged/smoky to vibrant/healthy) as users maintain vape-free streaks, using engaging animations and rewards. The app tracks progress, offers motivational tools, and prioritizes privacy with secure data storage and optional anonymous use. Built with Swift/SwiftUI for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, it’s iOS-only for now, with potential Android expansion later.

## Key Features
1. **Onboarding and User Profile**:
   - Sign-up: Email, Apple/Google auth, or guest mode.
   - Profile: Age, vaping history, quit goals (e.g., "reduce to zero in 30 days").
   - Personalized quit plan: AI-generated roadmap with daily tips (via backend).

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Daily check-in: Log vape-free status, cravings, or slips.
   - Streak counter: Tracks consecutive vape-free days/weeks.
   - Stats dashboard: Graphs for time saved, money saved (based on user-input vape costs), health improvements (e.g., "Lungs clearing: 20% better").

3. **Gamification with Lung Character**:
   - **Lung Buddy**: Animated lung-shaped character (modern, minimalist, not childish—like Duolingo’s owl but health-focused).
     - Starts "injured": Gray, coughing, cracks.
     - Heals over time: Color returns (pink/healthy), smoother animations, unlockable accessories (e.g., sunglasses for milestones).
     - Tied to streaks: 1 day = minor repair, 7 days = full color, 30 days = supercharged mode with bonuses.
   - Levels and Badges: Earn XP from check-ins/quests. Levels unlock skins, themes, or backgrounds.
   - Daily Quests: Health tasks (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water," "Walk 5k steps") integrated with HealthKit.
   - Rewards: Virtual trophies, shareable stickers, or future discount codes via partnerships.

4. **Educational and Support Resources**:
   - In-app library: Articles/videos on vaping risks, quit strategies (e.g., from CDC/WHO).
   - Craving Tools: Breathing exercises, mini-games (e.g., puzzles).
   - Community Feed: Optional anonymous milestone sharing (e.g., "Day 5 streak!").
   - Emergency Support: One-tap access to quit hotlines or AI counselor.

5. **Notifications and Reminders**:
   - Push notifications: Encouragement, quest reminders, streak savers (customizable frequency).
   - Local and remote notifications via UserNotifications and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

6. **Analytics and Export**:
   - Export progress reports (PDF) for doctors.
   - Basic analytics: Visualize craving patterns (e.g., evening peaks).

## UI/UX Design Principles
- **Modern and Professional**: Clean, sans-serif font (San Francisco), calming blues/greens with vibrant pink accents for the lung character, minimalist layouts, ample white space.
- **Youth Appeal**: Subtle animations (lung pulsing), swipe gestures, dark mode, optional AR filters for fun.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, VoiceOver support, scalable text.
- **Screens Flow**:
  - Home: Lung character centerpiece, streak counter, quick actions.
  - Quests: Daily/weekly challenges list.
  - Progress: Charts and history.
  - Resources: Searchable content.
  - Profile: Settings, exports.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - SwiftUI: For declarative UI, responsive layouts, and animations (e.g., lung healing via Canvas/TimelineView).
  - Swift: For logic, data models, integrations (UserDefaults, Combine for reactivity).
- **Backend**:
  - Firebase: Serverless BaaS for iOS.
    - Firestore: Real-time database for user data, progress, streaks.
    - Authentication: Email, Apple, Google, or anonymous sign-up.
    - Cloud Functions: Logic for XP calculations, healing stages.
    - Storage: Character assets (skins, accessories).
    - Firebase Cloud Messaging: Push notifications.
    - Analytics: Usage tracking.
    - Offline support: Firestore caching.
  - Alternative (if preferred): Vapor (Swift web framework) with PostgreSQL, hosted on Heroku/Fly.io, but Firebase is recommended for simplicity.
- **Other Tools**:
  - State Management: @State, @ObservedObject, Combine publishers.
  - Notifications: UserNotifications framework + Firebase.
  - Integrations: HealthKit for activity data.
  - Analytics: Firebase Analytics or Appcues.
  - Version Control: Git/GitHub.

## Development Plan
1. **Setup (1 week)**:
   - Create Xcode project with SwiftUI.
   - Integrate Firebase SDK via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.
   - Set up app structure: AppDelegate, scenes, initial views.

2. **Core Development (4-5 weeks)**:
   - Build onboarding/auth with Firebase.
   - Implement tracking logic and data models in Swift.
   - Develop lung character in SwiftUI: Shapes, animations (e.g., withAnimatable for healing), streak-driven updates.
   - Add gamification: Quests as structs, levels via Cloud Functions.
   - Integrate resources (local or Firestore-fetched).

3. **UI Polish and Features (2 weeks)**:
   - Refine screens: Home, quests, progress, resources, profile.
   - Add notifications and community features (Firestore for posts).
   - Ensure offline support with Firestore caching.

4. **Testing and Iteration (2-3 weeks)**:
   - **Unit Testing**: XCTest for logic (e.g., streak calculations, models).
   - **UI Testing**: XCUITest for automated UI interactions (e.g., check-ins, lung animations).
   - **Simulator Testing**: Xcode iOS Simulator for multiple devices (iPhone 14, iPad) and iOS versions.
   - **Device Testing**: Run on physical iOS devices via USB for real-world testing (battery, notifications).
   - **Beta Testing**: Distribute via TestFlight for tester feedback (email invites, in-app surveys, Crashlytics).
   - **Performance**: Use Xcode Instruments for CPU/memory profiling, debug with breakpoints/LLDB.
   - **CI/CD**: Xcode Cloud or GitHub Actions with Fastlane for automated builds/tests.
   - **User Testing**: Recruit young testers (forums, friends) for appeal/usability feedback. Optional: UserTesting.com for remote sessions.
   - **Edge Cases**: Test offline mode, data sync, accessibility (VoiceOver).

5. **Launch and Maintenance**:
   - Submit to App Store via Xcode/App Store Connect.
   - Monitor crashes with Firebase Crashlytics.
   - Updates: App Store deployments, Firebase Remote Config for tweaks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 2 months for MVP (solo dev). iOS-only; Android would need separate Kotlin/Jetpack Compose build.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **iOS-Only Limitation**: If Android is needed, consider Flutter for cross-platform or separate Kotlin build later.
- **Testing**: Xcode’s tools (XCTest, XCUITest, Simulator, TestFlight) cover comprehensive testing; no Expo required.
- **Backend Sync**: Robust Swift error handling for network issues.
- **Animation Performance**: Optimize SwiftUI views, test on older devices (e.g., iPhone 11).
- **Privacy**: Comply with GDPR/Apple guidelines; no data selling, clear user consent.
- **Youth Appeal vs. Professional**: Test with target audience to balance fun and credibility.

## Notes for Development
- Start with Firebase for backend to reduce complexity; switch to Vapor only if custom server logic is critical.
- Focus on smooth lung animations: Use SwiftUI’s Canvas or SpriteKit for complex effects if needed.
- Validate with users early to ensure the lung character resonates (not too childish).
- Keep code modular: Separate concerns (e.g., data models, UI, Firebase logic) for easier maintenance.
