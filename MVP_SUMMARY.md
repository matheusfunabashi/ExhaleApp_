## 🫁 Lung Character System

The centerpiece lung character features:
- **5 Health Levels** (0-100) based on vape-free streak
- **Visual Progression**: Gray → Light Pink → Pink → Healthy Pink → Glowing
- **Facial Expressions**: Sad/sick → neutral → slight smile → big smile
- **Animations**: Breathing pulse, glow effects, sparkles for healthy lungs
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately based on user progress

## 🎮 Gamification Features

### Quest System
- **12 Predefined Quests** across 4 categories:
  - Health: Hydration, exercise, healthy eating
  - Mindfulness: Meditation, breathing exercises, gratitude
  - Social: Connection with friends/family, community support
  - Education: Learning about vaping risks and benefits

### Progression System
- **XP Rewards**: 10-35 XP per quest completion
- **Level System**: Level up every 100 XP
- **Badge System**: Unlock achievements for streaks and milestones
- **Statistics**: Track total XP, completed quests, money saved

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Daily Check-ins
- Vape-free status (Yes/No)
- Cravings intensity (1-5 scale with descriptions)
- Mood selection (5 emoji-based moods with colors)
- Personal notes and reflections

### Charts & Analytics
- Daily check-in success/slip visualization
- Cravings level trends over time
- Health milestone progress
- Money saved calculations

### Health Milestones
- 20 minutes: Heart rate and blood pressure improvements
- 72 hours: Nicotine elimination
- 1 week: Taste and smell improvements
- 1 month: 30% lung function increase
- 3 months: Circulation improvements
- 1 year: Heart disease risk reduction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+ target
- Firebase account (for full functionality)

### Quick Setup
1. **Open Project**: Double-click `LungQuest.xcodeproj`
2. **Add Dependencies**: Swift Package Manager will handle Firebase SDK
3. **Firebase Config**: Replace GoogleService-Info.plist with your project config
4. **Build & Run**: Select simulator or device and run (⌘+R)

### Firebase Configuration (Optional)
For full cloud functionality:
1. Create Firebase project
2. Enable Firestore, Authentication, Storage
3. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
4. Replace placeholder file in project

**Note**: App works with local storage if Firebase isn't configured.

## 💡 Key Implementation Highlights

### Custom SwiftUI Components
- **LungShape**: Custom Shape protocol implementation for lung anatomy
- **LungCharacter**: Complex animated view with health-based rendering
- **Interactive Charts**: Using Swift Charts framework for data visualization
- **Modal Presentations**: Smooth sheet presentations for check-ins and settings

### State Management
- **Reactive Design**: Uses Combine for real-time UI updates
- **Centralized State**: Single AppState manages all app data
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic saving/loading of user progress
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Animations**: 60fps lung breathing and glow effects
- **Lazy Loading**: LazyVGrid and LazyVStack for large data sets
- **Image Optimization**: SF Symbols for consistent iconography
- **Memory Management**: Proper SwiftUI lifecycle handling

## 🎯 Testing the MVP

### User Flows to Test
1. **Onboarding**: Complete 4-step setup process
2. **Daily Check-in**: Log vape-free day with mood and cravings
3. **Quest Completion**: Complete daily challenges to earn XP
4. **Progress Viewing**: Check charts and statistics
5. **Character Evolution**: Watch lung character heal over multiple days
6. **Profile Management**: Edit user information and settings

### Sample Data
The app includes sample quests and milestone data, so you can immediately:
- Complete quests to see XP progression
- Check in daily to build streaks
- Watch the lung character change health levels
- Unlock badges and achievements

## 🚀 Next Steps

This MVP provides a solid foundation for:
- App Store submission
- User testing and feedback
- Feature expansion
- Android development (separate codebase)

The codebase is clean, well-documented, and follows iOS development best practices, making it ready for production deployment or further development.
